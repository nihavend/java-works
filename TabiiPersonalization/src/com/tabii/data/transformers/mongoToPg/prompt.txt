- in class named LookupRelationProcessor
- write a java funciton named processLookupRelations(Document show, Long contentId, Connection pgConn)
- show document has node named "fields"
- fields node may have these nodes "parental-guide", "age-restriction", "category", "exclusive-badge", "badge", "genre", "badges" some are object arrays some are not handle any

	in show document  exclusive_badge is exclusive_badge

- sample fields object:

{
    "age-restriction": {
        "title": "13+",
        "contentId": 26
    },
    "exclusive_badge": [

- all this nodes have contentId that identifies the nodes
- each of these seven nodes must exist in lookup_objects table in pg which has columnsbelow that you can use to find the related record
	id bigint NOT NULL,
    type text COLLATE pg_catalog."default" NOT NULL,

- check and if the any node does not exist in lookup_objects table log and exit

- for each node insert relation of lookup_objects and contents into content_lookup_relations table which has fields:

    content_id bigint NOT NULL,
    lookup_object_id bigint NOT NULL,
    relation_type text COLLATE pg_catalog."default" NOT NULL,
    
    show id corresponds to content_id, lookup_object_id corresponds to contentId of 7 given nodes and node names(e.g. category) corresponds to relation_type
    
        
- write a test function to check given show has migrated correctly with relations 
- do not make assumptions ask if necessary
- verify relation should only verify that in given show all related lookup objects are in lookup_objects table
